# How to run the app

- Clone the repo
- Make sure you have expo installed
- Make sure you have some emulator or an iOS device to view the project on.
- run `npm i` to install packages
- run `npm start`
- follow instructions in the terminal on how to open the app in an emulator or scan the QR-code with your iOS device.

## Notes

- I have been working with React on the web for a few of years, but sadly it's hard finding React Native assignments. I have therefore only been building a few side projects on my own in Native, hence I will use this as an excuse for using Expo to complete this test.

- I am really eager to learn more about Native, as I love the entire Javascript ecosystem and as with anything you enjoy, you have an easier time learning it.

## Things I would improve if there was time

- TESTS - I guess I got smacked in the face for using Expo. After spending 1-2 hours trying to fix peer-dependency issues while setting up testing-library + jest I had to give up. I have experience with writing unit tests for web with similar tools, and also end-to-end tests with cypress. I understand the importance of proper testing.

- Network request error handling - Would be nice to handle errors differently depending on the error, and give the user more of a hint. Also in a more central way, as you would in any project of scale.

- Styling - Obviously I would love to improve the styling, but I focused on the code-quality and structure rather than coming up with a good design as time was limited.

- Add reducer with actions to context - For scalablity and structure this would be a good addition.
